<title>46elks app (official name not yet decided)</title>
</head>
<body>

<p>Created this app for 46elks AB during a summer internship. A user can log in with an already existing 46elks account, or create a new one. When hitting the "Create your account" button, wait for an incoming phonecall on the phonenumber entered and follow the instructions prompted. In the app you can enter the text to be sent, add new contacts and add those contacts to groups. The groups-function is not fully implemented yet so only use the following user case for testing of groups: create a group, add contacts to it and then you can add that group once to the recipients on the middle tab. A part from the groups you are free to add and delete contacts from the recipients and edit the text to be sent. Then hit send and the message will be sent to the recipients, paid for by your free 46elks trial credits. The contacts and groups are saved to a local SQL database, thus accesible whenever you log in again. However since they are not synced up with the cloud they will be deleted if the app is deleted.</p>
